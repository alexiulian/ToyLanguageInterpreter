# ToyLanguage
- This project implements a fully functional toy language that explores the behind the scenes of how programming languages actually work.
- It is developed fully in **Java** and uses **javafx** for the Graphical User Interface
- The focus of the project was to implement a **custom execution stack, symbol table, file table, heap table and output table**. It also has a working **garbage collector** and even support for **multithreading** via **synchronization mechanisms** like barriers, mutexes, countdown latches.
#
The UI was developed with maven, using javafx .
